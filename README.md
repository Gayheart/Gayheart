- 👋 Hi, I’m @Gayheart
- 👀 I’m interested in basically making life easier with technology. Experimenting and creating new things with whats available, searching and learning relevant past and new developments.
- 🌱 I’m a pharmacist who is currently (and would forever! lol) into data science and cloud engineering, aiming to harness the power of these fields to come up with cost effective solutions.
- 💞️ I’m looking to partner with people equally new to browse this broad field, and the more experienced to help as pointers
- 📫 mawuenalawoe@gmail.com. if you wanna contact me
