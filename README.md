- 👋 Hi, I’m @Gayheart
- 👀 I’m interested in basically making life easier with technology. Experimenting and creating new things with whats available, searching and learning personally relevant past and new developments.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of computer science, and figuring out which field which may catch my fancy or a neccesity for my plans.
- 💞️ I’m looking to partner with people equally new to browse this broad field, and the more experienced to help as pointers
- 📫 mawuenalawoe@gmail.com. if you wanna contact me
